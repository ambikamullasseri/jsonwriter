JSONWriter supports the generation of JSON format text from a Dom4J Document.

This first pass implementation doesn't handle namespaces, is basically
just a quick hack of XMLWriter, has very few JUnit tests (like XMLWriter),
and is almost completely devoid of meaningful comments. It also depends
on Java 5.0, whereas the 1.6.1 source was designed for Java 1.3.

On the plus side, it supports at least my own understanding of the three
JSON formats: Basic Output, RabbitFish and BabbleFish, which are thinly
documented on the following web pages:
